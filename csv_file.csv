IntroducciÃ³n a Java;Me llamo Elisa Viso y una de mis pasiones es la de programar y enseÃ±ar a programar. El lenguaje Java es uno de los que mÃ¡s me ha gustado en mis 45 aÃ±os que llevo programando. Si bien te podrÃ¡ parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos bÃ¡sicos verÃ¡s quÃ© rÃ¡pido se avanza.Java, como todos los lenguajes de programaciÃ³n bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con mÃ¡s trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de cÃ³mo piensas la soluciÃ³n al problema). Pero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extraÃ±o, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como tÃº quieres y obtengas una satisfacciÃ³n enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.Este es un curso introductorio a la programaciÃ³n en Java. Como Java es un lenguaje orientado a objetos de propÃ³sito general, revisaremos los conceptos bÃ¡sicos del lenguaje como clases e interfaces. Veremos los ingredientes bÃ¡sicos de una clase como constantes y variables, funciones (mÃ©todos), y cÃ³mo organizar estos ingredientes dentro de una clase. TambiÃ©n veremos la utilizaciÃ³n de clases de las bibliotecas de Java.En el primer mÃ³dulo revisaremos el concepto de orientaciÃ³n a objetos aplicÃ¡ndolo en la vida real.En el segundo mÃ³dulo revisamos una herramienta de diseÃ±o orientado a objetos, llamada tarjetas de responsabilidades, y a partir de estas Ãºltimas diseÃ±amos los encabezados de los distintos servicios que se van a dar, codificÃ¡ndolos en una interfaz.En el tercer mÃ³dulo terminaremos la construcciÃ³n de la clase que corresponde a este problema, aclarando tÃ©rminos comunes en Java, revisando la sintaxis del lenguaje y la autodocumentaciÃ³n con la que cuenta.En el cuarto mÃ³dulo utilizaremos lo que ya tenemos para construir una clase mÃ¡s compleja que proporciones arreglos de objetos de la clase que ya tenemos y examinando con bastante profundidad tanto el esquema conceptual de los arreglos como su implementaciÃ³n en el modelo de memoria de Java.En el quinto y Ãºltimo mÃ³dulo profundizaremos en el uso de repeticiÃ³n en ejecuciÃ³n y, no puede faltar, los distintos tipos de ejecuciÃ³n condicional que provee el lenguaje.En este curso se proveerÃ¡ al participante con conocimientos del lenguaje Java que le permitirÃ¡n resolver una amplia gama de problemas con este lenguaje. AprenderÃ¡ a:â¢	Plantear la soluciÃ³n de un problema utilizando orientaciÃ³n a objetos.â¢	Programar la soluciÃ³n de los problemas utilizando las siguientes caracterÃ­sticas del lenguaje Java:               -Interfaces y clases               -MÃ©todos constructores de objetos, de acceso, de actualizaciÃ³n, de implementaciÃ³n y auxiliares.               -Atributos y variables locales de tipos primitivos o de clase.               -UtilizaciÃ³n de clases de biblioteca.               -Esquemas de ejecuciÃ³n como la repeticiÃ³n y la selecciÃ³n de enunciados               -Arreglos;Elisa Viso GurovichProfesora de la Facultad de Ciencias Departamento de MatemÃ¡ticas84,833 Learners1 Course, Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xicoLa Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico fue fundada el 21 de septiembre de 1551 con el nombre de la Real y Pontificia Universidad de MÃ©xico.

Introduction to Programming with MATLAB;This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in todayâs job market.Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.Students taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course.

Computational Social Science Specialization;For more information please view the Computational Social Science TrailerDigital technology has not only revolutionized society, but also the way we can study it. Currently, this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in Silicon Valley, the most powerful governmental agencies, and the most influential social movements. What they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand, and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics.An increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind. Studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works, including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure. Computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine learning and to natural language processing. Finally, computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality, but that we would like to exist: a better world.This specialization serves as a multidisciplinary, multi-perspective, and multi-method guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools. This specialization gives you easy access to some of the exciting new possibilities of how to study society and human behavior.

Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose;The basis for education in the last millennium was âreading, writing, and arithmetic,â now it is reading, writing, and computing. Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer scienceâs undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course covers the first half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). Our intent is to teach programming to those who need or want to learn it, in a scientific context. We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.We use the Java programming language and teach basic skills for computational problem solving that are applicable in many modern computing environments. Proficiency in Java is a goal, but we focus on fundamental concepts in programming, not Java per se.All the features of this course are available for free. It does not offer a certificate upon completion.;Robert SedgewickWilliam O. Baker *39 Professor of Computer ScienceComputer Science664,789 Learners6 Courses, Kevin WaynePhillip Y.

Game Theory;Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind," game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call `games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them?

Autodesk CAD/CAM/CAE for Mechanical Engineering Specialization;The demand placed on todayâs engineers goes above and beyond the job description. Products have become complex and engineers are more frequently asked to leave specialized roles and to take on a wide variety of tasks that are beyond their traditional responsibilities. These tasks are centered on form, fit, and function. Engineers need to factor in broader concerns such as cost, procurement, sustainability, manufacturability, and serviceability. Their role has moved away from an individual responsibility to working as part of a collaborative engineering team, executing tradeoffs with both engineering and business stakeholders to meet project goals. These trends have forced todayâs engineers to broaden their skillset to be successful.Engineers today are required to be on the cutting edge of design innovation. This means not only understanding engineering principles that govern the title and role, but also perfecting the toolsets needed to design and develop products.Through this specialization, youâll learn the foundations of applying computer aided design (CAD), computer aided engineering (CAE), and manufacturing principles while developing your technical skills within Autodesk Fusion 360.;Autodesk64,906 Learners22 Courses, AutodeskToday's challenges will be solved by tomorrow's designers.

Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis;This course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistics, starting with the concept of probability and moving to the analysis of data. We will learn about the philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data. We will compare the Bayesian approach to the more commonly-taught Frequentist approach, and see some of the benefits of the Bayesian approach. In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty, results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source, freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will give you an understanding of the concepts of the Bayesian approach, understanding the key differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, and the ability to do basic data analyses.;Herbert LeeProfessorApplied Mathematics and Statistics89,125 Learners1 Course, University of California, Santa CruzUC Santa Cruz is an outstanding public research university with a deep commitment to undergraduate education.

Machine Learning for All;Machine Learning, often called Artificial Intelligence or AI, is one of the most exciting areas of technology at the moment. We see daily news stories that herald new breakthroughs in facial recognition technology, self driving cars or computers that can have a conversation just like a real person. Machine Learning technology is set to revolutionise almost any area of human life and work, and so will affect all our lives, and so you are likely to want to find out more about it. Machine Learning has a reputation for being one of the most complex areas of computer science, requiring advanced mathematics and engineering skills to understand it. While it is true that working as a Machine Learning engineer does involve a lot of mathematics and programming, we believe that anyone can understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning, and given the importance of this technology, everyone should. The big AI breakthroughs sound like science fiction, but they come down to a simple idea: the use of data to train statistical algorithms. In this course you will learn to understand the basic idea of machine learning, even if you don't have any background in math or programming. Not only that, you will get hands on and use user friendly tools developed at Goldsmiths, University of London to actually do a machine learning project: training a computer to recognise images. This course is for a lot of different people. It could be a good first step into a technical career in Machine Learning, after all it is always better to start with the high level concepts before the technical details, but it is also great if your role is non-technical. You might be a manager or other non-technical role in a company that is considering using Machine Learning. You really need to understand this technology, and this course is a great place to get that understanding. Or you might just be following the news reports about AI and interested in finding out more about the hottest new technology of the moment. Whoever you are, we are looking forward to guiding you through you first machine learning project.NB this course is designed to introduce you to Machine Learning without needing any programming. That means that we don't cover the programming based machine learning tools like python and TensorFlow.;Dr Marco GilliesSenior LecturerComputing Department, Goldsmiths, University of London187,794 Learners12 Courses, University of LondonThe University of London is a federal University which includes 18 world leading Colleges.

Sample-based Learning Methods;In this course, you will learn about several algorithms that can learn near optimal policies based on trial and error interaction with the environment---learning from the agentâs own experience. Learning from actual experience is striking because it requires no prior knowledge of the environmentâs dynamics, yet can still attain optimal behavior. We will cover intuitively simple but powerful Monte Carlo methods, and temporal difference learning methods including Q-learning. We will wrap up this course investigating how we can get the best of both worlds: algorithms that can combine model-based planning (similar to dynamic programming) and temporal difference updates to radically accelerate learning.By the end of this course you will be able to: - Understand Temporal-Difference learning and Monte Carlo as two strategies for estimating value functions from sampled experience- Understand the importance of exploration, when using sampled experience rather than dynamic programming sweeps within a model- Understand the connections between Monte Carlo and Dynamic Programming and TD. - Implement and apply the TD algorithm, for estimating value functions- Implement and apply Expected Sarsa and Q-learning (two TD methods for control) - Understand the difference between on-policy and off-policy control- Understand planning with simulated experience (as opposed to classic planning strategies)- Implement a model-based approach to RL, called Dyna, which uses simulated experience - Conduct an empirical study to see the improvements in sample efficiency when using Dyna;Martha WhiteAssistant ProfessorComputing Science21,189 Learners4 Courses, Adam WhiteAssistant ProfessorComputing Science21,189 Learners4 Courses, University of AlbertaUAlberta is considered among the worldâs leading public research- and teaching-intensive universities.

Practical Time Series Analysis;Welcome to Practical Time Series Analysis!Many of us are "accidental" data analysts. We trained in the sciences, business, or engineering and then found ourselves confronted with data for which we have no formal analytic training.  This course is designed for people with some technical competencies who would like more than a "cookbook" approach, but who still need to concentrate on the routine sorts of presentation and analysis that deepen the understanding of our professional topics. In practical Time Series Analysis we look at data sets that represent sequential information, such as stock prices, annual rainfall, sunspot activity, the price of agricultural products, and more.  We look at several mathematical models that might be used to describe the processes which generate these types of data. We also look at graphical representations that provide insights into our data. Finally, we also learn how to make forecasts that say intelligent things about what we might expect in the future.Please take a few minutes to explore the course site. You will find video lectures with supporting written materials as well as quizzes to help emphasize important points. The language for the course is R, a free implementation of the S language.

An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1);This two-part course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications. Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.In part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game "Pong".;John GreinerLecturerDepartment of Computer Science 162,348 Learners2 Courses, Stephen WongLecturerComputer Science162,348 Learners2 Courses, Scott RixnerProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, Joe WarrenProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, Rice UniversityRice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world.

Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I);Named a top 50 MOOC of all time by Class Central!This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.In the first half of the course, we investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.In the second half of the course, we examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.Finally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go "dormant" within a host for many years before causing an active infection.;Pavel  PevznerProfessorDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering 334,866 Learners11 Courses, Phillip CompeauVisiting ResearcherDepartment of Computer Science &amp, Engineering122,689 Learners8 Courses, University of California San DiegoUC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Introduction to C# Programming and Unity;This course is all about starting to learn how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before, we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building small games by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games.Computer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially the first half of a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.Module 1: Write your first C# console application and Unity script and learn how we store data in our programsModule 2: Learn how we use classes and objects to implement our codeModule 3: Learn the basics of Unity 2D games and discover how we make decisions in our codeModule 4: Get and use player input in your Unity gamesModule 5: Complete final peer review and take "Final Exam"âUnityâ is a trademark or registered trademark of Unity Technologies or its affiliates in the U.S. and elsewhere.This course is an independent work and is not sponsored by, authorized by, or affiliated with Unity Technologies or its affiliates;Dr. Tim "Dr. T" ChamillardAssociate ProfessorComputer Science83,125 Learners11 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

The Unix Workbench;Unix forms a foundation that is often very helpful for accomplishing other goals you might have for you and your computer, whether that goal is running a business, writing a book, curing disease, or creating the next great app. The means to these goals are sometimes carried out by writing software. Software canât be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isnât produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if youâre not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas. This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Most of the technologies discussed in this course will be accessed via a command line interface. Command line interfaces can seem alien at first, so this course attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you would normally take while using your mouse and keyboard. Youâll also learn how to write little pieces of software in a programming language called Bash, which allows you to connect together the tools weâll discuss.

Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing;In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.Digital images and videos are everywhere these days â in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains.

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics;This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in anintroductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which isnatural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is notformal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into acompetent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functionalanalysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for themethods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the FiniteElement Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematicalfoundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary mannerpresented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections tothe physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs inone dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). Wethen move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction andmass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problemsin vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs inthree dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses toquestions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars whofollowed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematicaldevelopment to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.Books:There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a requiredtextbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broadertreatments than can be provided in any form of class:The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.Hughes, Dover Publications, 2000.The Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C.

Programming Languages, Part A;This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language âfits togetherâ to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.;Dan  GrossmanProfessorComputer Science &amp, Engineering88,876 Learners3 Courses, University of WashingtonFounded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world.;Introduction and Course-Wide Information (Start Here), Software Installation and Homework 0, Section 1 and Homework 1, Section 2 and Homework 2, Section 3 and Homework 3 -- and Course Motivation, Section 4 and Part-A Exam;4.9;

Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark;Manipulating big data distributed over a cluster using functional concepts is rampant in industry, and is arguably one of the first widespread industrial uses of functional ideas. This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course, we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for improved performance.Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:- read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark,- manipulate data with Spark and Scala,- express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style, - recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark,Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

We learn about Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing by building up models using Keras on real-life examples from IoT (Internet of Things), Financial Marked Data, Literature or Image Databases. Finally, we learn how to scale those artificial brains using Kubernetes, Apache Spark and GPUs.IMPORTANT: THIS COURSE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE "IBM Watson IoT Certified Data Scientist certificate". You need to take three other courses where two of them are currently built. The Specialization will be ready late spring, early summer 2018Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If youâre already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give your ideas for turbocharging successful creation and deployment of DeepLearning models. If youâre struggling, youâll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If youâve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve as your guide.Prerequisites: Some coding skills are necessary. Preferably python, but any other programming language will do fine. Also some basic understanding of math (linear algebra) is a plus, but we will cover that part in the first week as well.If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.

How Computers Work;Computers are everywhere, they aren't just the desktops and laptops we use for work but the phones in our pockets and even the watches on our wrists are also computers. You probably use a computer every day and in fact you are reading this on a computer! Just because we use computers all the time, doesn't mean that we understand them, or find them easy to use. Computer Science is the science of computers, it is the field of knowledge that experts use to understand computer systems. Knowing a little computer science will help you understand the computers all around you. This isn't a how-to course for a particular piece of software, instead you will learn some fundamental concepts that you can apply to any software or computer system. You'll apply these concepts to the kind of computer systems we use every day, including word processing applications, e-commerce, the internet and web sites. You will learn how to apply computer science concepts to solve problems in daily computer use and generally be a better computer user. Taking this course could be the start of your career in computer science, and the course is an introduction to the Bachelors in Computer Science from University of London, but it is also for you if you just want to learn a little computer science to help you better understand the computers you use in your ordinary life.;Dr Marco GilliesSenior LecturerComputing Department, Goldsmiths, University of London187,794 Learners12 Courses, University of LondonThe University of London is a federal University which includes 18 world leading Colleges.

Java for Android;This MOOC teaches you how to program core features and classes from the Java programming language that are used in Android, which is the dominant platform for developing and deploying mobile device apps. In particular, this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Javaâs various looping constructs and conditional statements), enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  Learners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments.;Dr. Jerry RothProfessor of the PracticeElectrical Engineering and Computer Science103,591 Learners2 Courses, Dr. Julie L.

Linear Regression in R for Public Health ;Welcome to Linear Regression in R for Public Health!Public Health has been defined as âthe art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of societyâ. Knowing what causes disease and what makes it worse are clearly vital parts of this. This requires the development of statistical models that describe how patient and environmental factors affect our chances of getting ill. This course will show you how to create such models from scratch, beginning with introducing you to the concept of correlation and  linear regression before walking you through importing and examining your data, and then showing you how to fit models. Using the example of respiratory disease, these models will describe how patient and other factors affect outcomes such as lung function. Linear regression is one of a family of regression models, and the other courses in this series will cover two further members. Regression models have many things in common with each other, though the mathematical details differ. This course will show you how to prepare the data, assess how well the model fits the data, and test its underlying assumptions â vital tasks with any type of regression. You will use the free and versatile software package R, used by statisticians and data scientists in academia, governments and industry worldwide.;Alex BottleReader in Medical StatisticsSchool of Public Health14,882 Learners5 Courses, Victoria CorneliusSenior Lecturer in Medical Statistics and Clinical Trials3,407 Learners2 Courses, Imperial College LondonImperial College London is a world top ten university with an international reputation for excellence in science, engineering, medicine and business. located in the heart of London.

Reproducible Research;This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.;Roger D.

Problem Solving, Python Programming, and Video Games;This course is an introduction to computer science and programming in Python.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:1.  Take a new computational problem and develop a plan to solve it through problem understanding and decomposition.2.  Follow a design creation process that includes specifications, algorithms, and testing.3.  Code, test, and debug a program in Python, based on your design.Important computer science concepts such as problem solving (computational thinking), problem decomposition, algorithms, abstraction, and software quality are emphasized throughout.  The Python programming language and video games are used to demonstrate computer science concepts in a concrete and fun manner.  However, a learner can take the knowledge and skills from this course and apply them to non-game problems, other programming languages, and other computer science courses.You do not need any previous programming, Python, or video game experience.  However, some computer skills (e.g., mouse, keyboard, document editing), knowledge of algebra, attention to detail (as with many technical subjects), and a âjust give it a tryâ spirit will be keys to your success.  Despite the use of video games for all the programming examples, PVG is not about computer games.  PVG will still provide valuable knowledge and skills for non-game computational problems.The interactive learning objects (ILO) of the course provide automatic, context-specific guidance and feedback, like a virtual teaching assistant, as you develop problem descriptions, algorithms, and functional test plans.

Machine Learning: Classification;Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment &amp, Loan Default PredictionIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. In this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.     -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.     -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.     -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.   -Use techniques for handling missing data.   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).;Carlos GuestrinAmazon Professor of Machine LearningComputer Science and Engineering288,562 Learners6 Courses, Emily FoxAmazon Professor of Machine LearningStatistics288,562 Learners6 Courses, University of WashingtonFounded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world.;Welcome!, Linear Classifiers &amp, Logistic Regression, Learning Linear Classifiers, Overfitting &amp, Regularization in Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Preventing Overfitting in Decision Trees, Handling Missing Data, Boosting, Precision-Recall, Scaling to Huge Datasets &amp, Online Learning;4.7;

Competitive Programmer's Core Skills;During the course, youâll learn everything needed to participate in real competitions â thatâs the main goal. Along the way youâll also gain useful skills for which competitive programmers are so highly valued by employers: ability to write efficient, reliable, and compact code, manage your time well when itâs limited, apply basic algorithmic ideas to real problems, etc.We start from the very beginning by teaching you what competitions there are, what are their rules, what specifics problems have, how to read problem statements, how to organize your work, and what you should and shouldnât do. So itâs fine if youâve never taken part in programming competitions before.Weâll focus on skills essential to competitive programming: inventing solutions and proving their correctness, estimating their running time, testing and debugging programs, how to benefit from structuring code. Weâll also cover basic algorithmic ideas: brute force search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, segment trees.On competitions, there are a lot of specific pitfalls, perilous to beginners â but thatâs not to worry, as weâll go through the most common of them: integer overflow and issues with fractional numbers, troubles of particular programming languages, how to get unstuck in general.And, youâll hone all these skills by solving practice problems, which are just like problems on real competitions. You could use any of the following programming languages: C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python 2, Python 3, Ruby, Rust, Scala. We assume that you already know how to write simplest programs in one of these.;Alexander S.

Introduction to UI Design;In this course, you will gain an understanding of the critical importance of user interface design. You will also learn industry-standard methods for how to approach the design of a user interface and key theories and frameworks that underlie the design of most interfaces you use today.Through a series of case studies on commercial systems - many of which you likely use on a regular basis - we will illustrate the benefits of good design. We will also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe (in user experience, money, and even human lives).You will then gain a high-level understanding of the user-interface design process. You will be introduced to common design scenarios - e.g. improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch - and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario.Finally, we will begin introducing the large body of existing knowledge on design by providing overviews of core user interface design theories and concepts. This key foundational information will help you avoid âreinventing the wheelâ when you are designing your interfaces in this specialization.;Loren TerveenProfessorComputer Science and Engineering42,117 Learners5 Courses, Haiyi ZhuAssistant ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering42,117 Learners5 Courses, Lana YaroshAssistant ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering42,117 Learners5 Courses, Dr. Brent HechtAssistant ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering42,117 Learners5 Courses, Joseph A KonstanDistinguished McKnight Professor and Distinguished University Teaching ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering129,581 Learners11 Courses, University of MinnesotaThe University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.

Ruby on Rails: An Introduction;Did you ever want to build a web application?  Perhaps you even started down that path in a language like Java or C#, when you realized that there was so much âclimbing the mountainâ that you had to do? Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.In this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the âcloudâ using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortlessâ¦ Really! âBut waitâ, you will say, âthere is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.â Great point! But what ifâ¦ instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? âOk, but thatâs probably very complicatedâ, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!;Kalman HazinsAdjunct Professor, Graduate Computer ScienceWhiting School of Engineering71,644 Learners2 Courses, Johns Hopkins UniversityThe mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.;Welcome and Setting Up the Development Environment, Introduction to Ruby, Introduction to Ruby on Rails;4.5;

Materials Data Sciences and Informatics;This course aims to provide a succinct overview of the emerging discipline of Materials Informatics at the intersection of materials science, computational science, and information science. Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.;Dr. Surya KalidindiProfessorThe George W.

Machine Learning: Clustering &amp, Retrieval;Case Studies: Finding Similar DocumentsA reader is interested in a specific news article and you want to find similar articles to recommend.  What is the right notion of similarity?  Moreover, what if there are millions of other documents?  Each time you want to a retrieve a new document, do you need to search through all other documents?  How do you group similar documents together?  How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?

Automating Real-World Tasks with Python;In the final course, we'll tie together the concepts that youâve learned up until now. You'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge you to use multiple skills at once.First, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend your code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. We'll show you some simple examples of how to perform common tasks in the course material, but it will be up to you to explore the module documentation to figure out how to solve specific problems.Next, we'll show you how to communicate with the world outside of your code! You'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages.At the end of this course, youâll be able to take a description of a problem and use your skills to create a solution -- just like you would on the job. In your final capstone project, you'll be given a description of what your customer needs, and it will be up to you to create a program to do it!;GoogleTop Instructor385,437 Learners14 Courses, GoogleThe IT Support Professional Certificate program is part of Grow with Google, an initiative that draws on Google's 20-year history of building products, platforms, and services that help people and businesses grow.

Inferential Statistics;Inferential statistics are concerned with making inferences based on relations found in the sample, to relations in the population. Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.We will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. For those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisherâs exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).;Annemarie Zand ScholtenAssistant ProfessorEconomics and Business89,934 Learners3 Courses, Emiel van LoonAssistant ProfessorInstitute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics185,391 Learners2 Courses, University of AmsterdamA modern university with a rich history, the University of Amsterdam(UvA) traces its roots back to 1632, when the Golden Age school AthenaeumIllustre was established to train students in trade and philosophy.

Data Structures and Performance;How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science, and in particular, we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).  In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.  This is an intermediate Java course, and we will build on your prior knowledge.

Logistic Regression in R for Public Health;Welcome to Logistic Regression in R for Public Health! Why logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression? Well, there are some particular considerations for every data set, and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word, they're messy. Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesnât just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. By the end of this course, you will be able to: Explain when it is valid to use logistic regression Define odds and odds ratios Run simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output Evaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R Describe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model This course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation. If you are unfamiliar with these skills, we suggest you review Statistical Thinking for Public Health and Linear Regression for Public Health before beginning this course. If you are already familiar with these skills, we are confident that you will enjoy furthering your knowledge and skills in Statistics for Public Health: Logistic Regression for Public Health.

Survival Analysis in R for Public Health;Welcome to Survival Analysis in R for Public Health!The three earlier courses in this series covered statistical thinking, correlation, linear regression and logistic regression. This one will show you how to run survival â or âtime to eventâ â analysis, explaining whatâs meant by familiar-sounding but deceptive terms like hazard and censoring, which have specific meanings in this context. Using the popular and completely free software R, youâll learn how to take a data set from scratch, import it into R, run essential descriptive analyses to get to know the dataâs features and quirks, and progress from Kaplan-Meier plots through to multiple Cox regression. Youâll use data simulated from real, messy patient-level data for patients admitted to hospital with heart failure and learn how to explore which factors predict their subsequent mortality. Youâll learn how to test model assumptions and fit to the data and some simple tricks to get round common problems that real public health data have. There will be mini-quizzes on the videos and the R exercises with feedback along the way to check your understanding.PrerequisitesSome formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results. The three previous courses in the series explained concepts such as hypothesis testing, p values, confidence intervals, correlation and regression and showed how to install R and run basic commands. In this course, we will recap all these core ideas in brief, but if you are unfamiliar with them, then you may prefer to take the first course in particular, Statistical Thinking in Public Health, and perhaps also the second, on linear regression, before embarking on this one.;Alex BottleReader in Medical StatisticsSchool of Public Health14,882 Learners5 Courses, Imperial College LondonImperial College London is a world top ten university with an international reputation for excellence in science, engineering, medicine and business. located in the heart of London.

Building Arduino robots and devices;For many years now, people have been improving their tools, studying the forces of nature and bringing them under control, using the energy of the nature to operate their machines. Last century is noted for the creation of machines which can operate other machines. Nowadays the creation of devices that interact with the physical world is available to anyone. Our course consists of a series of practical problems on making things that work independently: they make their own decisions, act, move, communicate with each other and people around, and control other devices. We will demonstrate how to assemble such devices and programme them using the Arduino platform as a basis.After this course, you will be able to create devices that read the data about the external world with a variety of sensors, receive and forward this data to a PC, the Internet and mobile devices, and control indexing and the movement. The creation of such devices will involve design, the study of their components, the assemblage of circuit boards, coding and diagnostics. Along with the creation of the devices themselves, you will perform visualization on a PC, create a web page that will demonstrate one of your devices, and figure out how an FDM 3D-printer is configured and how it functions.   Besides those keen on robotics or looking to broaden their horizons and develop their skills, the course will also be useful to anyone facing the task of home and industrial automation, as well as to anyone engaged in industrial design, advertising and art. The course does not require any special knowledge from the participants and is open even to students of upper secondary school. Programming skills and the level of English allowing to read technical documentation would be an advantage, but this is not obligatory.The entire course is dedicated to practice, so the best way for you would be to get hold of some electronics, follow the illustrated examples and experiment on your own.The kits can be purchased here: kits.cyberphysica.ru.Taught by: Alexey Perepelkin, head of Robotics department in the Laboratory of innovative educational technologies at MIPTTaught by: Dmitry Savitsky, researcher in the Laboratory of innovative educational technologies at MIPT;ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐµÐ¹ ÐÐµÑÐµÐ¿ÐµÐ»ÐºÐ¸Ð½Ð ÑÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸ÑÐµÐ»Ñ Ð½Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ°Ð²Ð»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ ÑÐ°Ð·Ð²Ð¸ÑÐ¸Ñ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ ÑÐ²Ð¾ÑÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð°Ð¦ÐµÐ½ÑÑ Ð¸Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½ÑÑ Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð·Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»ÑÐ½ÑÑ ÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸Ð¹ ÐÐ¤Ð¢Ð65,335 Learners2 Courses, ÐÐ¼Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¡Ð°Ð²Ð¸ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐ¾ÑÑÑÐ´Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐÐ°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ°ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¸Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½ÑÑ Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð·Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»ÑÐ½ÑÑ ÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸Ð¹ ÐÐ¤Ð¢Ð65,335 Learners2 Courses, Moscow Institute of Physics and TechnologyÐÐ¾ÑÐºÐ¾Ð²ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÐ¸Ð·Ð¸ÐºÐ¾-ÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¸Ð½ÑÑÐ¸ÑÑÑ (Ð¤Ð¸Ð·ÑÐµÑ) ÑÐ²Ð»ÑÐµÑÑÑ Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ð¸Ð¼ Ð¸Ð· Ð²ÐµÐ´ÑÑÐ¸Ñ Ð²ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð² ÑÑÑÐ°Ð½Ñ Ð¸ Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ Ð² Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð½ÑÐµ ÑÐµÐ¹ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð³Ð¸ Ð»ÑÑÑÐ¸Ñ ÑÐ½Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑÑÐ¸ÑÐµÑÐ¾Ð² Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ°.

Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars;Welcome to Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars, the fourth course in University of Torontoâs Self-Driving Cars Specialization.This course will introduce you to the main planning tasks in autonomous driving, including mission planning, behavior planning and local planning.   By the end of this course, you will be able to find the shortest path over a graph or road network using Dijkstra's and the A* algorithm, use finite state machines to select safe behaviors to execute, and design optimal, smooth paths and velocity profiles to navigate safely around obstacles while obeying traffic laws.  You'll also build occupancy grid maps of static elements in the environment and learn how to use them for efficient collision checking. This course will give you the ability to construct a full self-driving planning solution, to take you from home to work while behaving like a typical driving and keeping the vehicle safe at all times.For the final project in this course, you will implement a hierarchical motion planner to navigate through a sequence of scenarios in the CARLA simulator, including avoiding a vehicle parked in your lane, following a lead vehicle and safely navigating an intersection.  You'll face real-world randomness and need to work to ensure your solution is robust to changes in the environment.This is an intermediate course, intended for learners with some background in robotics, and it builds on the models and controllers devised in Course 1 of this specialization. To succeed in this course, you should have programming experience in Python 3.0, and familiarity with Linear Algebra (matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication, rank, Eigenvalues and vectors and inverses) and calculus (ordinary differential equations, integration).;Steven WaslanderAssociate ProfessorAerospace Studies37,732 Learners4 Courses, Jonathan KellyAssistant ProfessorAerospace Studies36,160 Learners3 Courses, University of TorontoEstablished in 1827, the University of Toronto is one of the worldâs leading universities, renowned for its excellence in teaching, research, innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as its impact on economic prosperity and social well-being around the globe.;Welcome to Course 4: Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars, Module 1: The Planning Problem, Module 2: Mapping for Planning, Module 3: Mission Planning in Driving Environments, Module 4:  Dynamic Object Interactions, Module 5: Principles of Behaviour Planning, Module 6:  Reactive Planning in Static Environments, Module 7: Putting it all together - Smooth Local Planning;4.8;

Social Network Analysis;This course is designed to quite literally âmake a scienceâ out of something at the heart of society: social networks. Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.;Martin HilbertProfessorCommunication, Graduate Group Computer Science Chair Emphasis Computational Social Science4,363 Learners5 Courses, University of California, DavisUC Davis, one of the nationâs top-ranked research universities, is a global leader in agriculture, veterinary medicine, sustainability, environmental and biological sciences, and technology.

Bayesian Statistics;This course describes Bayesian statistics, in which one's inferences about parameters or hypotheses are updated as evidence accumulates. You will learn to use Bayesâ rule to transform prior probabilities into posterior probabilities, and be introduced to the underlying theory and perspective of the Bayesian paradigm. The course will apply Bayesian methods to several practical problems, to show end-to-end Bayesian analyses that move from framing the question to building models to eliciting prior probabilities to implementing in R (free statistical software) the final posterior distribution. Additionally, the course will introduce credible regions, Bayesian comparisons of means and proportions, Bayesian regression and inference using multiple models, and discussion of Bayesian prediction.We assume learners in this course have background knowledge equivalent to what is covered in the earlier three courses in this specialization: "Introduction to Probability and Data," "Inferential Statistics," and "Linear Regression and Modeling.";Mine Ãetinkaya-RundelAssociate Professor of the PracticeDepartment of Statistical Science220,030 Learners5 Courses, David BanksProfessor of the PracticeStatistical Science54,598 Learners2 Courses, Colin Rundel Assistant Professor of the PracticeStatistical Science54,598 Learners2 Courses, Merlise A ClydeProfessorDepartment of Statistical Science54,598 Learners2 Courses, Duke UniversityDuke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

Combinatorics and Probability;Counting is one of the basic mathematically related tasks we encounter on a day to day basis. The main question here is the following. If we need to count something, can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.In this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.One of the main `consumersâ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.In the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.Do you have technical problems? Write to us: coursera@hse.ru;Alexander S.

Computers, Waves, Simulations: A Practical Introduction to Numerical Methods using Python;Interested in learning how to solve partial differential equations with numerical methods and how to turn them into python codes? This course provides you with a basic introduction how to apply methods like the finite-difference method, the pseudospectral method, the linear and spectral element method to the 1D (or 2D) scalar wave equation. The mathematical derivation of the computational algorithm is accompanied by python codes embedded in Jupyter notebooks. In a unique setup you can see how the mathematical equations are transformed to a computer code and the results visualized. The emphasis is on illustrating the fundamental mathematical ingredients of the various numerical methods (e.g., Taylor series, Fourier series, differentiation, function interpolation, numerical integration) and how they compare. You will be provided with strategies how to ensure your solutions are correct, for example benchmarking with analytical solutions or convergence tests. The mathematical aspects are complemented by a basic introduction to wave physics, discretization, meshes, parallel programming, computing models. The course targets anyone who aims at developing or using numerical methods applied to partial differential equations and is seeking a practical introduction at a basic level.

An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2);This two-part course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications. Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.In part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game "Asteroids".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.  The next course in the specialization will begin to introduce a more principled approach to writing programs and solving computational problems that will allow you to write larger and more complex programs.;Joe WarrenProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, Scott RixnerProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, John GreinerLecturerDepartment of Computer Science 162,348 Learners2 Courses, Stephen WongLecturerComputer Science162,348 Learners2 Courses, Rice UniversityRice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world.

Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II);You may have heard a lot about genome sequencing and its potential to usher in an era of personalized medicine, but what does it mean to sequence a genome?Biologists still cannot read the nucleotides of an entire genome as you would read a book from beginning to end. However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. In the first half of the course, we will see that biologists cannot read the 3 billion nucleotides of a human genome as you would read a book from beginning to end.  However, they can read shorter fragments of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces in what amounts to the largest jigsaw puzzle ever put together.In the second half of the course, we will discuss antibiotics, a topic of great relevance as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria like MRSA are on the rise.  You know antibiotics as drugs, but on the molecular level they are short mini-proteins that have been engineered by bacteria to kill their enemies.  Determining the sequence of amino acids making up one of these antibiotics is an important research problem, and one that is similar to that of sequencing a genome by assembling tiny fragments of DNA.  We will see how brute force algorithms that try every possible solution are able to identify naturally occurring antibiotics so that they can be synthesized in a lab.Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium that has acquired antibiotics resistance.;Pavel  PevznerProfessorDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering 334,866 Learners11 Courses, Phillip CompeauVisiting ResearcherDepartment of Computer Science &amp, Engineering122,689 Learners8 Courses, University of California San DiegoUC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Text Retrieval and Search Engines;Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about peopleâs opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. This course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.;ChengXiang ZhaiProfessorDepartment of Computer Science65,255 Learners4 Courses, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.

Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking;Have you ever heard that computers "think"? Believe it or not, computers really do not think. Instead, they do exactly what we tell them to do. Programming is, "telling the computer what to do and how to do it."Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want to tell the computer to do. Thinking through problems this way is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation. This project will be completed in stages (and milestones) and will also include a final disaster response plan you'll share with other learners like you.This course is designed for anyone who is just beginning programming, is thinking about programming or simply wants to understand a new way of thinking about problems critically. No prior programming is needed. The examples in this course may feel particularly relevant to a High School audience and were designed to be understandable by anyone.You will learn:-To define Computational Thinking components including abstraction, problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithms, and evaluating solutions-To recognize Computational Thinking concepts in practice through a series of real-world case examples-To develop solutions through the application of Computational Thinking concepts to real world problems;Chris QuintanaAssociate ProfessorSchool of Education1,420 Learners1 Course, University of MichiganThe mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.;Foundations of Computational Thinking, Case Study: Airport Surveillance and Image Analysis, Case Study: Epidemiology, Case Study: Human Trafficking, Final Project;4.8;

Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous course in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking that previous course or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed in the "Who this class is for" section below. Throughout this course you'll continue building your foundational C# and Unity knowledge by exploring more C# and Unity topics and finishing the Unity game you started at the end of the previous course.The material in this and the previous course is essentially our first programming course for Game Design and Development majors at UCCS.Module 1: Learn how we can store lots of data in arrays and lists and use iteration (looping) to repeat actions in your codeModule 2: Learn about abstraction and how we can use it to design and implement console application classesModule 3: Learn how we can use abstraction to design and implement Unity classesModule 4: Add text output (like score!) and sound effects to your Unity gamesModule 5: Complete final peer reviewâUnityâ is a trademark or registered trademark of Unity Technologies or its affiliates in the U.S. and elsewhere.This course is an independent work and is not sponsored by, authorized by, or affiliated with Unity Technologies or its affiliates;Dr. Tim "Dr. T" ChamillardAssociate ProfessorComputer Science83,125 Learners11 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Number Theory and Cryptography;We all learn numbers from the childhood. Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbersâ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said âThe Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematicsâ. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.Do you have technical problems? Write to us: coursera@hse.ru;Alexander S.

Advanced R Programming;This course covers advanced topics in R programming that are necessary for developing powerful, robust, and reusable data science tools. Topics covered include functional programming in R, robust error handling, object oriented programming, profiling and benchmarking, debugging, and proper design of functions. Upon completing this course you will be able to identify and abstract common data analysis tasks and to encapsulate them in user-facing functions. Because every data science environment encounters unique data challenges, there is always a need to develop custom software specific to your organizationâs mission. You will also be able to define new data types in R and to develop a universe of functionality specific to those data types to enable cleaner execution of data science tasks and stronger reusability within a team.;Roger D.

Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet Infrastructures;In this course we will examine the aviation and Internet infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered "lifeline infrastructure" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA.;Richard WhiteAssistant Research ProfessorComputer Science12,658 Learners7 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS;Do you want to write powerful, maintainable, and testable front end applications faster and with less code? Then consider joining this course to gain skills in one of the most popular Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks today, AngularJS. Developed and backed by Google, AngularJS is a very marketable skill to acquire.In this course, we will explore the core design of AngularJS 1.x (latest version of AngularJS 1), its components and code organization techniques. We will enhance the functionality of our web app by utilizing dependency injection to reuse existing services as well as write our own. We will create reusable HTML components that take advantage of AngularJS data binding as well as extend HTML syntax with a very powerful feature of AngularJS called directives. Weâll set up routing so our SPA can have multiple views. We will also learn how to unit test our functionality. At the end of this course, you will build a fully functional, well organized and tested web application using AngularJS and deploy it to the cloud.;Yaakov ChaikinAdjunct Professor, Graduate Computer ScienceWhiting School of Engineering261,933 Learners2 Courses, Johns Hopkins UniversityThe mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.;Introduction to AngularJS, Module 2 - Filters, Digest Cycle, Controller Inheritance, and Custom Services, Week 3 - Promises, Ajax, and Custom Directives, Module 4 - Components, Events, Modules, and Routing, Module 5 - Form Validation, Testing, and Restaurant Site Development;4.9;

World Design for Video Games;Start creating your world. A game world is not just a backdrop for your gameâbe it minimal or detailed, contained or part of a much bigger universe, it provides the context for your player. Ultimately, a game world should feel alive and wholly unique to any player who will experience it. In this course, we will explore game worlds in existing games and study the art and influences that inform their themes and styles. We will also investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. Weâll also look at navigation and the elements that make your world as real (or unreal) as you want it to be. A weekly challenge will prompt you to explore styles and inspirations for possible game worlds, and youâll learn effective ways to communicate your ideas from concepts to presentation-worthy proofs of concept.;ThÃ©otime VaillantInstructor, Experimental AnimationSchool of Film/Video21,379 Learners2 Courses, California Institute of the ArtsCalArts has earned an international reputation as the leading college of the visual and performing arts in the United States.

Population Health: Responsible Data Analysis;In most areas of health, data is being used to make important decisions.  As a health population manager, you will have the opportunity to use data to answer interesting questions. In this course, we will discuss data analysis from a responsible perspective, which will help you to extract useful information from data and enlarge your knowledge about specific aspects of interest of the population. First, you will learn how to obtain, safely gather, clean and explore data. Then, we will discuss that because data are usually obtained from a sample of a limited number of individuals, statistical methods are needed to make claims about the whole population of interest. You will discover how statistical inference, hypothesis testing and regression techniques will help you to make the connection between samples and populations.A final important aspect is interpreting and reporting. How can we transform information into knowledge? How can we separate trustworthy information from noise? In the last part of the course, we will cover the critical assessment of the results, and we will discuss challenges and dangers of data analysis in the era of big data and massive amounts of information.Â  In this course, we will emphasize the concepts and we will also teach you how to effectively perform your analysis using R. You do not need to install R on your computer to follow the course, you will be able to access R and all the example data sets within the Coursera environment.

Computer Simulations;Big data and artificial intelligence get most of the press about computational social science, but maybe the most complex aspect of it refers to using computational tools to explore and develop social science theory. This course shows how computer simulations are being used to explore the realm of what is theoretically possible. Computer simulations allow us to study why societies are the way they are, and to dream about the world we would like to live in. This can be as intuitive as playing a video game. Much like the well-known video game SimCity is used to build and manage an artificial city, we use agent-based models to grow and study artificial societies. Without hurting anyone in the real world, computer simulations allow us explore how to make the world a better place. We play hands-on with several practical computer simulation models and explore how we can combine hypothetical models with real world data. Finally, you will program a simple artificial society yourself, bottom-up. This will allow you to feel the complexity that arises when designing social systems, while at the same time experiencing the ease with which our new computational tools allow us to pursue such daunting endeavors.;Martin HilbertProfessorCommunication, Graduate Group Computer Science Chair Emphasis Computational Social Science4,363 Learners5 Courses, University of California, DavisUC Davis, one of the nationâs top-ranked research universities, is a global leader in agriculture, veterinary medicine, sustainability, environmental and biological sciences, and technology.

Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III);Once we have sequenced genomes in the previous course, we would like to compare them to determine how species have evolved and what makes them different.In the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.  We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.In the second half of the course, we will "zoom out" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are "fragile" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.;Pavel  PevznerProfessorDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering 334,866 Learners11 Courses, Phillip CompeauVisiting ResearcherDepartment of Computer Science &amp, Engineering122,689 Learners8 Courses, Nikolay VyahhiVisiting ScholarDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering9,711 Learners1 Course, University of California San DiegoUC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Practice;This course is for anyone passionate about learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!The more general purpose you are, the more flexible you are and the more kinds of programs and algorithms you can execute on your underlying computing infrastructure. All of this is terrific, but there is no free food and this is happening, quite often, by losing in efficiency.This course will present several scenarios where the workloads require more performance than can be obtained even by using the fastest CPUs. This scenario is turning cloud and data center architectures toward accelerated computing. Within this course, we are going to show you how to gain benefits by using Xilinx SDAccel to program Amazon EC2 F1 instances. We are going to do this through a working example of an algorithm used in computational biology.The huge amount of data the algorithms need to process and their complexity raised the problem of increasing the amount of computational power needed to perform the computation. In this scenario, hardware accelerators revealed to be effective in achieving a speed-up in the computation while, at the same time, saving power consumption. Among the algorithms used in computational biology, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment between two strings that could be nucleotides or proteins. In the following classes, we present an analysis and successive FPGA-based hardware acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm used to perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences.Within this context, this course is focusing on distributed, heterogeneous cloud infrastructures, providing you details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel, through working examples, to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.;Marco Domenico SantambrogioAssociate ProfessorDEIB - Dept. of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering6,873 Learners3 Courses, Politecnico di MilanoPolitecnico di Milano is a scientific-technological University, which trains engineers, architects and industrial designers.From 2014 Politecnico di Milano started the release of several MOOCs, developed by the service for digital learning METID (Methods and Innovative Technologies for Learning), giving everybody the chance to enhance personal skills.;Reconfigurable cloud infrastructure, On how to accelerate the cloud with SDAccel, Summing things up: the Smith-Waterman algorithm, The Smith-Waterman example in details, Course conclusions;4.3;

Delivery Problem;Weâll implement (in Python) together efficient programs for a problem needed by delivery companies all over the world millions times per day â the travelling salesman problem. The goal in this problem is to visit all the given places as quickly as possible. How to find an optimal solution to this problem quickly? We still donât have provably efficient algorithms for this difficult computational problem and this is the essence of the P versus NP problem, the most important open question in Computer Science. Still, weâll implement several solutions for real world instances of the travelling salesman problem. While designing these solutions, we will rely heavily on the material learned in the courses of the specialization: proof techniques, combinatorics, probability, graph theory.

Videojuegos: Â¿de quÃ© hablamos?;VERSIÃN EN ESPAÃOLProbablemente, todos hemos jugado a algÃºn videojuego, pero Â¿quÃ© hay detrÃ¡s de Ã©l? Podemos decir que - con independencia del videojuego - hay un Ã¡rduo trabajo multidisciplinar que incluye desde aspectos de diseÃ±o hasta la programaciÃ³n como tal del videojuego. Este curso pretende ser un curso introductorio que muestre quÃ© aspectos hay que considerar en el videojuego, y que permita con posterioridad abordar individualmente los temas que se consideran nucleares: diseÃ±o, arte, motor del videojuego y 'game play'. Al completar este curso introductorio, podrÃ¡s identificar, nombrar y explicar la importancia de los diferentes aspectos que hay que considerar al diseÃ±ar un videojuego. Pretendemos tambiÃ©n que puedas evaluar quÃ© partes del videojuego te interesan mÃ¡s, de cara a que puedas seguir un curso especÃ­fico sobre esa temÃ¡tica, o bien, si deseas el conocimiento global, puedas abordar todo el programa especializado. EstarÃ¡s listo para abordar mÃ¡s en profundidad estos temas nucleares (diseÃ±o, arte, motor del videojuego y 'gameplay') que se cubren de forma individualizada y en detalle en el resto de cursos del programa especializado.IMPORTANTEPuedes seguir el curso tambiÃ©n en InglÃ©s (subtÃ­tulos y cuestionarios).__________________ENGLISH VERSIONWe have all probably played a video game at least once in our life, but... what's behind them? We can say that -no matter what game it is- there's a difficult multidisciplinary work that involves factors that go from the design to the video game's programming. This is an introductory course that will show you which aspects we must consider in the video game, and it will subsequently help you to individually study the different videogames creation's nucleus: design, art, video game engine and gameplay.When you finish this introductory course, you will be able to identify, tell and explain the importance of the many aspects we must consider when designing a video game. We also want you to be able to avaluate which parts of a video game you're most interested in, so that you can later take the specific course on this topic -if you seek global knowledge you can see all the specialised program. Then you'll be ready to study more deeply these main topics -design, art, video game engine and gameplay- which are individually studied with detail during the other courses of the specialized program.IMPORTANTYou are able to follow this course in English (subtitles and quizzes).;Enric MartÃ­ GÃ²diaAssociate ProfessorComputer Science24,543 Learners6 Courses, Pere Nolla RodrÃ­guezFreelance y Colaborador docenteCiencias de la ComputaciÃ³n (UAB)21,903 Learners4 Courses, Jordi Arnal MontoyaCEO en Kaneda Games y Colaborador docenteCiencias de la ComputaciÃ³n (UAB)12,923 Learners4 Courses, Universitat AutÃ²noma de BarcelonaThe Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona (UAB) is a public university located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona.

Genome Assembly Programming Challenge;In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in LÃ¼beck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice â computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wikiThe 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.;Alexander S.

Data Structures and Design Patterns for Game Developers;This course is the fourth course in the specialization about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous three courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed in the "Who this class is for" section below.

Algorithms, Data Collection, and Starting to Code;This course starts you on your journey learning about computational thinking and beginning C programming. If youâd like to explore how we can interact with the world in a rigorous, computational way, and would also like to start learning to program, this is the course for you!You may have heard lots of talk about computational thinking recently, but if you ask 10 different people what it is youâll probably get 10 different answers. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, weâll just say itâs a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. In this course, weâll explore algorithms and data collection.Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means! Youâll start learning how to develop C programs in this course by writing your first C program, learning about data types, variables, and constants, and honing your C programming skills by implementing a variety of STEM computations. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience, so don't worry if you've never written code before.If that all sounds interesting to you, go ahead and jump into the course!Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since the courses in this specialization are built from a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.Module 1: Learn about algorithms and write your first C programModule 2: Discover how we store data in our programsModule 3: Explore how we use data collection to solve problems and answer questionsModule 4: Practice writing C programs to implement STEM computations;Dr. Tim "Dr. T" ChamillardAssociate ProfessorComputer Science83,125 Learners11 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data;In this capstone project weâll combine  all of the skills from all four specialization courses to do something really fun: analyze social networks!  The opportunities for learning are practically endless in a social network.  Who are the âinfluentialâ members of the network?  What are the sub-communities in the network?   Who is connected to whom, and by how many links?   These are just some of the questions you can explore in this project.We will provide you with a real-world data set and some infrastructure for getting started, as well as some warm up tasks and basic project requirements, but then itâll be up to you where you want to take the project.  If youâre running short on ideas, weâll have several suggested directions that can help get your creativity and imagination going.  Finally, to integrate the skills you acquired in course 4 (and to show off your project!) you will be asked to create a video showcase of your final product.;Christine AlvaradoAssociate Teaching ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering248,023 Learners5 Courses, Mia MinnesAssistant Teaching ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering248,023 Learners5 Courses, Leo PorterAssociate Teaching ProfessorComputer Science and Engineering248,023 Learners5 Courses, University of California San DiegoUC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2);Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.  This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.In part 2 of this course, we will study advanced algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.  As the central part of the course, students will implement several algorithms in Python that incorporate these techniques and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.Once students have completed this class, they will have both the mathematical and programming skills to analyze, design, and program solutions to a wide range of computational problems.  While this class will use Python as its vehicle of choice to practice Algorithmic Thinking, the concepts that you will learn in this class transcend any particular programming language.;Luay NakhlehAssociate ProfessorComputer Science, Biochemistry and Cell Biology 55,290 Learners5 Courses, Scott RixnerProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, Joe WarrenProfessorComputer Science234,579 Learners11 Courses, Rice UniversityRice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world.

Approximation Algorithms;Many real-world algorithmic problems cannot be solved efficiently using traditional algorithmic tools, for example because the problems are NP-hard. The goal of this course is to become familiar with important algorithmic concepts and techniques needed to effectively deal with such problems. These techniques apply when we don't require the optimal solution to certain problems, but an approximation that is close to the optimal solution. We will see how to efficiently find such approximations. Prerequisites:In order to successfully take this course, you should already have a basic knowledge of algorithms and mathematics. Here's a short list of what you are supposed to know:- O-notation, Î©-notation, Î-notation, how to analyze algorithms- Basic calculus: manipulating summations, solving recurrences, working with logarithms, etc.- Basic probability theory: events, probability distributions, random variables, expected values etc.- Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps- (Balanced) binary search trees- Basic sorting algorithms, for example MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort- Graph terminology, representations of graphs (adjacency lists and adjacency matrix), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest paths)The material for this course is based on the course notes that can be found under the resources tab.  We will not cover everything from the course notes. The course notes are there both for students who did not fully understand the lectures as well as for students who would like to dive deeper into the topics.The video lectures contain a few very minor mistakes. A list of these mistakes can be found under resources (in the document called "Errata"). If you think you found an error, report a problem by clicking the square flag at the bottom of the lecture or quiz where you found the error.;Mark de BergProf.dr.Mathematics and Computer Science2,300 Learners2 Courses, EIT Digital EIT Digital is a pan-European organization whose mission is to foster digital technology innovation and entrepreneurial talent for economic growth and quality of life.

Introduction to Formal Concept Analysis;This course is an introduction into formal concept analysis (FCA), a mathematical theory oriented at applications in knowledge representation, knowledge acquisition, data analysis and visualization. It provides tools for understanding the data by representing it as a hierarchy of concepts or, more exactly, a concept lattice. FCA can help in processing a wide class of data types providing a framework in which various data analysis and knowledge acquisition techniques can be formulated. In this course, we focus on some of these techniques, as well as cover the theoretical foundations and algorithmic issues of FCA.Upon completion of the course, the students will be able to use the mathematical techniques and computational tools of formal concept analysis in their own research projects involving data processing. Among other things, the students will learn about FCA-based approaches to clustering and dependency mining.The course is self-contained, although basic knowledge of elementary set theory, propositional logic, and probability theory would help.End-of-the-week quizzes include easy questions aimed at checking basic understanding of the topic, as well as more advanced problems that may require some effort to be solved.Do you have technical problems?

Software Design Threats and Mitigations;The design step in developing software has some unique characteristics.  First of all, itâs the only step where drawing pictures of things is the norm.  Why is that?  What do pictures do that other representations cannot do?  Pictures have varying levels of detail, pictures have context.  Picturesâ¦paint a picture.  Why are these things important?  In this course, too, we begin looking at other disciplines (building architecture is a favorite one) for lessons on design.;Albert GlockInstructorComputer Science5,964 Learners4 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Computational Thinking for K-12 Educators: Sequences and Loops;How do we give instructions to a computer?  Isn't programming hard?  Not really!  Whether it's giving someone directions to a nearby store or writing out some dance moves we frequently exhibit aspects of computational thinking in our everyday lives!  This class teaches the first key concepts of programming -- sequences of instructions and basic counted repetition of instructions.  For each concept, we'll start by helping you connect real-world experiences you are already familiar with to the programming concept you are about to learn.  Next, through a cognitively scaffolded process we'll engage you in developing your fluency with problem solving with sequences and repeated instructions in a way that keeps frustration at a minimum.  Along the way you will learn about the common challenges or "bugs" students have with these concepts as well as ways to help them find and fix those concepts.  You'll also be guided in running classroom discussions to help students develop deeper understanding of these concepts.Finally, you'll learn about a recommended pedagogical practice, Pair Programming, and find out why research recommends teaching block-based programming first.;Beth SimonTeaching ProfessorEducation Studies4,375 Learners21 Courses, University of California San DiegoUC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Requirements Specifications: Goals and Conflict Analysis;In Requirements Goal Development and Language Analysis, we move from the spoken word to precise writing.  A first step in this is writing goals.  We will talk about goals used in requirements engineering and, from this, writing use cases from what we learn.  Use cases can be in diagram and written form.  Then- the villains enter- misuse cases and abuse cases are discussed in how we can deal with them in a Requirements environment.  In gathering requirements, you'll have many questions remaining.  Often this leads to the need of more interviews and group sessions.  We'll go through how to handle group meetings, dealing with inconsistency, and handling conflict between stakeholders.;Kristen Walcott-JusticeAssistant ProfessorDepartment of Computer Science6,358 Learners5 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Approximation Algorithms Part I;Approximation algorithms, Part IHow efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. This course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem. The course content and in particular the homework is of a theoretical nature without any programming assignments.  This is the first of a two-part course on Approximation Algorithms.;Claire Mathieu21,924 Learners2 Courses, Ãcole normale supÃ©rieureLâÃcole normale supÃ©rieure (ENS) est un Ã©tablissement d'enseignement supÃ©rieur pour les Ã©tudes prÃ©doctorales et doctorales (graduate school) et un haut lieu de la recherche franÃ§aise.

For the programming topics, you'll continue building on your C knowledge by practicing using arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable, and strings, which are arrays of characters. You'll also learn how to implement functions, which are the mechanism we use for problem decomposition in our C programs.Module 1: Learn about arrays as a way to store multiple values in a single variableModule 2: Discover how we store and process strings (arrays of characters)Module 3: Explore abstraction and problem decompositionModule 4: Use functions to implement problem decomposition in your code;Dr. Tim "Dr. T" ChamillardAssociate ProfessorComputer Science83,125 Learners11 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

VLSI CAD Part II: Layout;You should complete the VLSI CAD Part I: Logic course before beginning this course.A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called âintellectual propertyâ or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.Recommended Background:Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.

Introduction to Statistics &amp, Data Analysis in Public Health;Welcome to Introduction to Statistics &amp, Data Analysis in Public Health!This course will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis - types of variables, common distributions, hypothesis testing - but, more than that, it will enable you to take a data set you've never seen before, describe its keys features, get to know its strengths and quirks, run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions. You'll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series. You'll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software R, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere. It's hands-on, so you'll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media. Then you'll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits: data that are realistically messy, because that's what public health data sets are like in reality. There will be mini-quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding. The course will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted: in this age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news, these skills are more important than ever.PrerequisitesSome formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need only basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results.

Advanced Modeling for Discrete Optimization;Optimization is a common form of decision making, and is ubiquitous in our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students who have completed Basic Modelling for Discrete Optimization. In this course you will learn much more about solving challenging discrete optimization problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest.  This course will focus on debugging and improving models, encapsulating parts of models in predicates, and tackling advanced scheduling and packing problems.

The Fundamentals of Computing Capstone Exam;While most specializations on Coursera conclude with a project-based course, students in the "Fundamentals of Computing" specialization have completed more than 20+ projects during the first six courses of the specialization. Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session, our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.With this objective in mind, the focus in this Capstone class will be an exam whose questions are updated periodically. This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help.

Embedded Software and Hardware Architecture;Embedded Software and Hardware Architecture is a first dive into understanding embedded architectures and writing software to manipulate this hardware. You will gain experience writing low-level firmware to directly interface hardware with highly efficient, readable and portable design practices. We will now transition from the Host Linux Machine where we built and ran code in a simulated environment to an Integrated Development Environment where you will build and install code directly on your ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller. Course assignments include writing firmware to interact and configure both the underlying ARM architecture and the MSP432 microcontroller platform. The course concludes with a project where you will develop a circular buffer data structure. In this course you will need the Texas Instruments LaunchPad with the MSP432 microcontroller in order to complete the assignments. Later courses of the Specialization will continue to use this hardware tool to develop even more exciting firmware.;Alex FosdickInstructorElectrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering43,656 Learners2 Courses, University of Colorado BoulderCU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country.

Introduction to numerical analysis;Numerical computations historically play a crucial role in natural sciences and engineering. These days however, itâs not only traditional Â«hard sciencesÂ»: whether you do digital humanities or biotechnology, whether you design novel materials or build artificial intelligence systems, virtually any quantitative work involves some amount of numerical computing .These days, you hardly ever implement the whole computation yourselves from scratch. We rely on libraries which package tried-and-tested, battle-hardened numerical primitives. It is vanishingly rare however that a library contains a single pre-packaged routine which does all what you need. Numerical computing involves assembling these building blocks into computational pipelines.This kind of work requires a general understanding of basic numerical methods, their strengths and weaknesses, their limitations and their failure modes. And this is exactly what this course is about. It is meant to be an introductory, foundational course in numerical analysis, with the focus on basic ideas. We will review and develop basic characteristics of numerical algorithms (convergence, approximation, stability, computational complexity and so on), and will illustrate them with several classic problems in numerical mathematics. You will also work on implementing abstract mathematical constructions into working prototypes of numerical code. Upon completion of this course, you will have an overview of the main ideas of numerical computing, and will have a solid foundation for reading up on and working with more advanced numerical needs of your specific subject area.As prerequisites for this course, we assume a basic command of college-level mathematics (linear algebra and calculus, mostly), and a basic level of programming proficiency.Do you have technical problems?

Asymmetric Cryptography and Key Management;Welcome to Asymmetric Cryptography and Key Management! In asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course, the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.This course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.;Sang-Yoon ChangAssistant ProfessorComputer Science12,946 Learners6 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Solving Algorithms for Discrete Optimization;Discrete Optimization aims to make good decisions when we have many possibilities to choose from. Its applications are ubiquitous throughout our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.This course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.Watch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EiRsK-Rm08;Prof. Jimmy Ho Man LeeProfessorDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering21,323 Learners6 Courses, Prof. Peter James StuckeyProfessorComputing and Information Systems23,675 Learners7 Courses, The University of MelbourneThe University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement.

Version Control with Git;The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently "know just enough Git to be dangerous". There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.;Steve ByrnesInstructional Designer73,580 Learners2 Courses, AtlassianOur missionWe believe all teams have potential to do amazing things.From space travel and DNA sequencing, to video games and nonprofits, our mission is to unleash the potential in every team and help advance humanity through the power of software.;Our First Repository, Branching and Merging I, Branching and Merging II, Git Workflows;4.8;

The Introduction to Quantum Computing;"Quantum Computing" is among those terms that are widely discussed but often poorly understood. The reasons of this state of affairs may be numerous, but possibly the most significant among them is that it is a relatively new scientific area, and it's clear interpretations are not yet widely spread. The main obstacle here is the word "quantum", which refers to quantum mechanics - one of the most counter-intuitive ways to describe our world.But fear not! This is not a course on quantum mechanics. We will gently touch it in the beginning and then leave it apart, concentrating on the mathematical model of quantum computer, generously developed for us by physicists. This doesn't mean that the whole course is mathematics either (however there will be enough of it). We will build a simple working quantum computer with our bare hands, and we will consider some algorithms, designed for bigger quantum computers which are not yet developed. The course material is designed for those computer scientists, engineers and programmers who believe, that there's something else than just HLL programming, that will move our computing power further into infinity.Since the course is introductory, the only prerequisites are complex numbers and linear algebra. These two are required and they have to be enough.

Introduction to Imagemaking;This course for serious makers, and for students new to imagemaking. Imagemaking is a fluid and exciting area of graphic design that comes out of practice and process: experimenting fearlessly, showing and sharing ideas, and giving and receiving knowledgeable and constructive input.For the sake of this online platform, we have applied some structure to our investigations, but for the most part imagemaking is loose and unstructured. If we must adopt a rule in this course it is only this: you will not become a graphic designer by watching videos alone. Or, don't just make stuff just in your head. So here, the focus here is on making, and you are expected to devote serious time and intellectual energy to that activity in this course. Specifically, you will: - experiment with a range of materials and techniques to make images for graphic design - expand your visual vocabulary both in terms of making and talking about work, in order to discuss your work and work of others - learn how to make, manipulate and arrange images to create compositions, eventually culminating in the design and production of an-image-based book.The first half of the course is an opportunity to experiment and explore imagemaking in order to expand your visual vocabulary. You will create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or try out a media.In the second two weeks, weâll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. Weâll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together by composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the imageâs connotations, meanings, and associations generated through elements of composition and âvisual contrasts.â Ultimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.The results of your assignments (and experiments) may generate something completely unknowable now or in the futureâand that's the goal.;Gail SwanlundFaculty in Graphic DesignSchool of Art51,838 Learners1 Course, California Institute of the ArtsCalArts has earned an international reputation as the leading college of the visual and performing arts in the United States.

Ãlgebra BÃ¡sica;Galileo dijo: "El Universo estÃ¡ escrito en lenguaje matemÃ¡tico y los caracteres son triÃ¡ngulos, cÃ­rculos y otras figuras geomÃ©tricas, sin las que es humanamente imposible entender una sola palabra".Para entender el Universo, es necesario plantear leyes que expliquen su comportamiento, como pueden ser las leyes de la gravedad, la propagaciÃ³n del calor, el electromagnetismo, la reproducciÃ³n celular, el crecimiento poblacional, la propagaciÃ³n de las enfermedades, la variaciÃ³n de los precios de las acciones en la bolsa de valores, el comportamiento de las masas ante un conflicto, etcÃ©tera.    Todas estas leyes se plantean utilizando ecuaciones, algunas muy sencillas, otras no tanto. Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el Ã¡lgebra.    Piensa en el Ã¡lgebra como la gramÃ¡tica, que nos dice cÃ³mo traducir nuestras ideas al lenguaje, cÃ³mo formar frases y oraciones a partir de palabras, cÃ³mo conjugar verbos, a identificar las partes de una oraciÃ³n, las reglas de acentuaciÃ³n, etcÃ©tera.

You will understand the process necessary for working with management and information owners, custodians, and users so that proper data classifications are defined. This will ensure the proper handling of all hard copy and electronic information.The Security operations and Administration course addresses basic security concepts and the application of those concepts in the day to day operation and administration of enterprise computer systems and the information that they host.Ethical considerations in general, and the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics in particular, provide the backdrop for any discussion of information security and SSCP candidates will be tested on both. Information security professionals often find themselves in positions of trust and must be beyond reproach in every way.Several core principles of information security stand above all others and this domain covers these principles in some depth. It can be said that the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability forms the basis for almost everything that we do in information security and the SSCP candidate must not only fully understand these principles but be able to apply them in all situations. additional security concepts covered in this domain include privacy, least privilege, non-repudiation and the separation of duties.   Course Objectives1. Define Code of Ethics2. Describe the security concepts3. Document and operate security controls4. Describe the asset management process5. Implement compliance controls6.

VLSI CAD Part I: Logic;A modern VLSI chip has a zillion parts -- logic, control, memory, interconnect, etc.  How do we design these complex chips?  Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called âintellectual propertyâ or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level).Recommended BackgroundProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but itâs not necessary.  We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.e tools in this class.;Rob A.

A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone);In this final course, you will put together your knowledge from Courses 1, 2 and 3 to implement a complete RL solution to a problem. This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms. This capstone is valuable for anyone who is planning on using RL to solve real problems.To be successful in this course, you will need to have completed Courses 1, 2, and 3 of this Specialization or the equivalent.By the end of this course, you will be able to: Complete an RL solution to a problem, starting from problem formulation, appropriate algorithm selection and implementation and empirical study into the effectiveness of the solution.;Martha WhiteAssistant ProfessorComputing Science21,189 Learners4 Courses, Adam WhiteAssistant ProfessorComputing Science21,189 Learners4 Courses, University of AlbertaUAlberta is considered among the worldâs leading public research- and teaching-intensive universities.

Probabilistic Graphical Models 2: Inference;Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions over complex domains: joint (multivariate) distributions over large numbers of random variables that interact with each other. These representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more. They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. This course is the second in a sequence of three. Following the first course, which focused on representation, this course addresses the question of probabilistic inference: how a PGM can be used to answer questions. Even though a PGM generally describes a very high dimensional distribution, its structure is designed so as to allow questions to be answered efficiently. The course presents both exact and approximate algorithms for different types of inference tasks, and discusses where each could best be applied.

Mobile Interaction Design: How to Design Usable Mobile Products and Services;Every mobile app gives you something. It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling, for instance, a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger. That "something" is actually the reason why you use the app, it is the heart of the product, and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldnât be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that "something" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users canât get what they want.The main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for peopleâs use. To do that, youâll need to learn:- Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process- User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones- Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods- The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design, information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the formerInterfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However, the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development, and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.What makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process, the representation of a designerâs decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems, and the processes of discovering and analysing them.Upon completion of the course, you will be able to:- Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems- Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product- Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g., extending an existing product to a new platform)The practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study, analysing gathered data, and making evidence-based design changes, which will enable you to create your first case study.This course was designed for those who are involved in creating digital interactive products (not necessarily for mobile) but do not have considerable experience in interaction design. If you are a UX professional in a junior position, a developer, manager or visual designer, this class is for you. This is not an introductory level course, so if you are new to the field, we recommend you take the âIntroduction to User Experience Designâ course from Georgia Institute of Technology before taking this one. Also, parts of this course such as the aforementioned process of design creation and approach to usability inspection can be useful for experienced designers.Do you have technical problems?

Arduino y algunas aplicaciones;Arduino es una iniciativa empleada para simplificar el uso de los microcontroladores, que surgiÃ³ en 2005 como resultado de un proyecto de estudiantes en el Instituto IVREA. NaciÃ³ con el objetivo de disminuir el costo de los microcontroladores, que entonces los estudiantes empleaban para sus proyectos y que resultaban demasiado costosos. Actualmente tiene diferentes usos, como la aplicaciÃ³n de desarrolladores de diseÃ±os artÃ­sticos e interactivos, de igual forma, muchas personas utilizan Arduino para incursionar en aplicaciones tecnolÃ³gicas, como la automatizaciÃ³n y la robÃ³tica.Su aplicaciÃ³n, aunque pudiera parecer limitada a Ã¡reas de la ciencia muy especializadas, es en realidad comÃºn, al encontrarla en un cajero automÃ¡tico, un calentador de agua, la pluma de un estacionamiento o las puertas de una plaza o supermercado, y es que este tipo de herramientas, que facilitan nuestra vida diaria, estÃ¡n basadas en un pequeÃ±o microcontrolador, cuya tarea estÃ¡ dictada por un programa.Programar es algo que hacemos dÃ­a con dÃ­a al planear nuestras actividades, pero si nos detenemos a organizar aquello que hacemos de manera inconsciente, obtendremos una serie ordenada de pasos que nos llevarÃ¡n a un objetivo, si tenemos esto claro seremos capaces de planear actividades mÃ¡s complejas.En este curso utilizaremos Arduino UNO para realizar dos prototipos que muestran el funcionamiento de dispositivos, como un chaleco para ciclista y un pastillero. No es requisito tener conocimientos de programaciÃ³n, sin embargo, conforme avances en el estudio de este curso probablemente necesites reforzar e investigar sobre algunos de los aspectos que aquÃ­ se expliquen.A travÃ©s de las actividades y material didÃ¡ctico de este curso aprenderÃ¡s a aplicar la tarjeta Arduino y podrÃ¡s adquirir y reforzar nociones bÃ¡sicas de programaciÃ³n, utilizando una herramienta de fÃ¡cil acceso, que te permitirÃ¡ ademÃ¡s elaborar posteriores proyectos de tu interÃ©s.SubtÃ­tulos disponibles en espaÃ±ol.Cuatro semanas de estudio.2-4 horas por semana.;Yukihiro Minami KoyamaProfesor titular en el Ãrea de IngenierÃ­a MecÃ¡nicaFacultad de IngenierÃ­a de la UNAM62,120 Learners1 Course, Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xicoLa Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico fue fundada el 21 de septiembre de 1551 con el nombre de la Real y Pontificia Universidad de MÃ©xico.

Windows Server Management and Security;Microsoft Windows has been at the forefront of enterprise computing for several decades.  What most office workers see is the desktop side â such as Windows 7, 8 or 10.  This course explores what it takes to design and build the server side of Windows in an enterprise environment.  This course will explore everything from Windows Server installation to configuring users, to hardening the server operating system itself.  This course is the second course in the System Management and Security Specialization focusing on enterprise system management.  The first week of this course provides an overview of how Windows operates in an enterprise environment and what it may look like in the real world.  Week 2 of the course will show you how Windows users interact with the system.  At the end of Week 2, you will be able to demonstrate how Windows authentication works at the end of Week 2.  Week 3 will explore authorization in a Windows environment.

Rails with Active Record and Action Pack;You already know how to build a basic web application with the Ruby on Rails framework. Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, "Ruby on Rails: An Introduction" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your âdata layerâ. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.In Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.;Kalman HazinsAdjunct Professor, Graduate Computer ScienceWhiting School of Engineering71,644 Learners2 Courses, Johns Hopkins UniversityThe mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.;Introduction to Active Record, Deep Dive into Active Record, Introduction to Action Pack, Security and Nested Resources in Action Pack;4.7;

I/O-efficient algorithms;Operations on data become more expensive when the data item is located higher in the memory hierarchy. An operation on data in CPU registers is roughly a million times faster than an operation on a data item that is located in external memory that needs to be fetched first. These data fetches are also called I/O operations and need to be taken into account during the design of an algorithm. The goal of this course is to become familiar with important algorithmic concepts and techniques needed to effectively deal with such problems. We will work with a simplified memory hierarchy, but the notions extend naturally to more realistic models. Prerequisites:In order to successfully take this course, you should already have a basic knowledge of algorithms and mathematics. Here's a short list of what you are supposed to know:- O-notation, Î©-notation, Î-notation, how to analyze algorithms- Basic calculus: manipulating summations, solving recurrences, working with logarithms, etc.- Basic probability theory: events, probability distributions, random variables, expected values etc.- Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps- (Balanced) binary search trees- Basic sorting algorithms, for example MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort- Graph terminology, representations of graphs (adjacency lists and adjacency matrix), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest paths)The material for this course is based on the course notes that can be found under the resources tab.  We will not cover everything from the course notes. The course notes are there both for students who did not fully understand the lectures as well as for students who would like to dive deeper into the topics.The video lectures contain a few very minor mistakes. A list of these mistakes can be found under resources. If you think you found an error, report a problem by clicking the square flag at the bottom of the lecture or quiz where you found the error.;Mark de BergProf.dr.Mathematics and Computer Science2,300 Learners2 Courses, EIT Digital EIT Digital is a pan-European organization whose mission is to foster digital technology innovation and entrepreneurial talent for economic growth and quality of life.

Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Theory;This course is for anyone passionate in learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!We are entering in an era in which technology progress induces paradigm shifts in computing!As a tradeoff between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, we can find a new concept, a new idea of computing... the reconfigurable computing, which has combined the advantages of both the previous worlds. Within this context, we can say that reconfigurable computing will widely, pervasively, and gradually impact human lives. Hence, it is time that we focus on how reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable system design techniques are to be utilised for building applications.One one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance.Within this context, the Xilinx SDx tools, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment, and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element, and having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor. The out-of-the-box experience will provide interesting and, let us say, âgood enoughâ results for many applications. However, this may not be true for you, you may be looking for better performance, data throughput, reduced latency, or to reduce the resources usage... This course is focusing exactly on this. After introducing you to the FPGAs we are going to dig more into the details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel providing you also with working examples on how to optimize the hardware logic to obtain the best of of your hardware implementations. In this case, certain attributes, directives, or pragmas, can be used to direct the compilation and synthesis of the hardware kernel, or to optimise the function of the data mover operating between the processor and the hardware logic.Furthermore, In this course we are going to focus on distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures, presenting how to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.;Marco Domenico SantambrogioAssociate ProfessorDEIB - Dept. of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering6,873 Learners3 Courses, Politecnico di MilanoPolitecnico di Milano is a scientific-technological University, which trains engineers, architects and industrial designers.From 2014 Politecnico di Milano started the release of several MOOCs, developed by the service for digital learning METID (Methods and Innovative Technologies for Learning), giving everybody the chance to enhance personal skills.;Familizarize youself with FPGA technologies, A bird's eye view on SDAccel , On how to optmize your system, Optimize your system via SDAccel, Other optimizations, An introduction to FPGA-augmented cloud infrastructures;4.7;

Advanced Business Analytics Capstone;The analytics process is a collection of interrelated activities that lead to better decisions and to a higher business performance. The capstone of this specialization is designed with the goal of allowing you to experience this process. The capstone project will take you from data to analysis and models, and ultimately to presentation of insights. In this capstone project, you will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. For the first week, the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  In the second week, you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.Beginning in the third week, we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.In the last week, you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients. Since you will obtain many results in your project, it is important for you to judiciously choose what to include in your presentation. You are also expected to follow the principles we covered in the courses in preparing your presentation.;Manuel LagunaProfessorLeeds School of Business22,814 Learners3 Courses, Dan ZhangProfessorLeeds School of Business18,097 Learners3 Courses, David TorgersonInstructor46,965 Learners3 Courses, University of Colorado BoulderCU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country.

And according to labor market analytics company Burning Glass, "thereâs nothing virtual about the jobs in this field. Theyâre here and now and very real." In this course, you'll learn how to design, develop, troubleshoot, and publish your own mobile VR applications in Unity for Google Daydream, Gear VR, or Oculus Go devices. Using the very latest techniques recommended by Unity's VR engineers, you'll build a complete VR environment that you can continue to use after the course, while learning to apply best practices in user experience, interaction, teleportation and navigation design for VR. In short, this course will take you from software developer to VR developer. This is the second of three courses in Unity's XR Specialization, which includes an Introduction to XR course as well as a planned course focused on developing handheld Augmented Reality (AR) applications with Unity. The course assumes that you already have experience developing applications with Unity and that you are comfortable with basic C# programming. It will also be helpful if you are familiar with building other types of apps to run on mobile devices.;Unity Technologies22,882 Learners17 Courses, Peter PattersonXR Architect / DeveloperContract Developer11,387 Learners3 Courses, UnityUnity Technologies offers a platform for creating beautiful and engaging 2D, 3D, VR, and AR games and apps.

SRS Documents: Requirements and Diagrammatic Notations;As requirements are being gathered and prioritized, they also need to be documented. In Diagrammatic Notations and Software Requirements Specification Writing, we discuss and practice the process of turning requirements into something readable to the customers at a high level, and the developers.  When a designer or developer reads your document, they should be able to understand the overall idea, the scope, the domain, the resources, the expectations, and why alternative choices are not selected. To create a document in this way, you use a balance between storytelling (with pictures!) and complex diagrams.;Kristen Walcott-JusticeAssistant ProfessorDepartment of Computer Science6,358 Learners5 Courses, University of Colorado SystemThe University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.

Addressing Large Hadron Collider Challenges by Machine Learning;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest data generation machine for the time being. It doesnât produce the big data, the data is gigantic. Just one of the four experiments generates thousands gigabytes per second. The intensity of data flow is only going to be increased over the time. So the data processing techniques have to be quite sophisticated and unique. In this course weâll introduce students into the main concepts of the Physics behind those data flow so the main puzzles of the Universe Physicists are seeking answers for will be much more transparent. Of course we will scrutinize the major stages of the data processing pipelines, and focus on the role of the Machine Learning techniques for such tasks as track pattern recognition, particle identification, online real-time processing (triggers) and search for very rare decays. The assignments of this course will give you opportunity to apply your skills in the search for the New Physics using advanced data analysis techniques. Upon the completion of the course you will understand both the principles of the Experimental Physics and Machine Learning much better.Do you have technical problems?

Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications;In this course, we will wear many hats. With our Attacker Hats on, we will exploit Injection issues that allow us to steal data, exploit Cross Site Scripting issues to compromise a users browser, break authentication to gain access to data and functionality reserved for the âAdminsâ, and even exploit vulnerable components to run our code on a remote server and access some secrets. We will also wear Defender Hats. We will dive deep in the code to fix the root cause of these issues and discuss various mitigation strategies. We do this by exploiting WebGoat, an OWASP project designed to teach penetration testing. WebGoat is a deliberately vulnerable application with many flaws and we take aim at fixing some of these issues. Finally we fix these issues in WebGoat and build our patched binaries. Together we will discuss online resources to help us along and find meaningful ways to give back to the larger Application Security community.;Joubin JabbariSoftware Security Architect, Financial IndustryContinuing and Professional Education1,262 Learners1 Course, University of California, DavisUC Davis, one of the nationâs top-ranked research universities, is a global leader in agriculture, veterinary medicine, sustainability, environmental and biological sciences, and technology.
